scaleFactor specifies how much the image size is reduced with each scale. 
In a group photo, there may be some faces which are near the camera than others.
Naturally, such faces would appear more prominent than the ones behind. 
This factor compensates for that.

minNeighbours specifies how many neighbours each candidate rectangle should have to
retain it. 
This parameter specifies the number of neighbours a rectangle should have to be called a face.
